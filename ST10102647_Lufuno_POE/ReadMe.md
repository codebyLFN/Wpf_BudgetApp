# Personal budget program

Individuals might use this project as a tool for budgeting. As a result, people should have a better understanding of their potential issues. In order for the 
program to generate an accurate report, users will be needed to provide their information.

## how does the program work

Users will be asked to enter their gross monthly income after deductions into the software. Then they enter their monthly tax deduction estimate. The users will next 
be asked to enter their monthly expenses under the following headings: groceries, water and electricity, travel costs (including gasoline), cell phones and telephones, and other expenses.

The program will prompt the user to select between renting and purchasing a home. If the user selects to rent an apartment, the system will prompt them to enter the
monthly rental amount. If the user chooses to buy a home, the program will prompt them to enter the property's purchase price, total deposit, interest rate,
and number of months to repay (between 240 and 360), after which the program will calculate the monthly home loan payments. The software will notify the user if
the monthly house loan repayment is more than a third of the user's gross monthly income, indicating that approval of the home loan is doubtful.


After all of the requested deductions have been made, the program will calculate the available monthly money and display it for the user to see.

## Motivation
The program's main purpose, as I explained to Siphiwe when I told him he needed some real statistics, was to help him better comprehend his prospective 
financial concerns. He couldn't tell if he was in financial difficulty without data, let alone what he could do to improve his condition if he was. As a result,
I'll be developing an app for setting personal budgets.
